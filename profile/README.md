The Speed ACM is the Association for Computing Machinery Student Chapter at the University of Louisville. We are dedicated to providing resources for students interested in all things computing! We foster community by hosting fun events such as alumni workshops, documentary screenings, gaming nights, community dinners, professional seminars, and volunteer opportunities. We also have Student Interest Groups (SIGs) dedicated to Game Development, Hardware Hacking, Linux, and Cybersecurity. Members often spend time with each other in our lab in the basement of the J.B. Speed School of Engineering building in Room LL002. Here, students can find a snack shop, a lending library of technology, textbooks, and a study space.
